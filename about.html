         <h3>ABOUT ME</h3>
          <p>My name is osman mohamed.I studied both my primary level and secondary at garissa county.
            i went to school know as ibnu-siina academy for my prymary. My secondary school was called Garissa High School.
            Unfortonetly am not yet employed in any work place.
            
            since i was a kid i had that feeling of one day create something using my computer or laptop.
            I dreamt thah one day it will be succesful. i first had about moringa from my friend who also 
            blieved in me, that i could do programing and became a programer in future.
            After alot of motivations from him and my inner self i decided to join moringa.
            Here i am coding and intracting with my laptop.
            Am so happy i can see the diffrence in me already.
